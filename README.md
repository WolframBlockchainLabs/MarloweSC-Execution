# MarloweSC-Execution

## Introduction
This repository contains proofs of achievement for the catalyst proposal #1100291 [Wolfram Marlowe Smart Contract Execution](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-use-cases-solution/wolfram-marlowe-smart-contract-execution).

### Problem
A Marlowe based financial contract needs three things: 
1) financial logic, 
2) real-time price feeds, and 
3) autonomous execution. Without these, the application is not ready for live deployment.

### Solution
Our solution puts real-time pricing data into a Marlowe smart contract and autonomously executes the internal logic. This workflow completes a round-trip financial contract without manual support.
